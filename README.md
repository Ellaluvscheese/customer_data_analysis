# Overview

I am using a dataset that I got from Kaggle and it is a set of fake customer data. It describes several things about the customer including: Customer ID,Age,Gender,Item Purchased,Category,Purchase Amount (USD),Location,Size,Color,Season,Review Rating,Subscription Status,Shipping Type,Discount Applied,Promo Code Used,Previous Purchases,Payment Method,Frequency of Purchases.

I have never used python to analyze data before and I am currently taking an advance writing a reasoning class and I became interested in asking questions and using data to answer them. I was also interested in learning about customer data and learning about ways to improve a companies sales.

# Data Analysis Results

Does gender affect the payment method?
    - No. The gender specific data showed to be similar. I did find that Paypal and Cash were the most implemented payment methods.

Should the company focus on promoting a subscription?
    - Yes. Over half of the customers are not subscribed and frequently come back to repurchase items.

# Development Environment

I used Python, Pandas, and MatplotLib to analyze this dataSet. I used MatplotLib to create visuals with the data from the csv file and I was able to draw my conclusion based off of the visuals I got.

# Future Work

* I need to find a better dataSet that has a bigger variety / is a better representation of customer data.
* Make the data filtering more efficient and improve the coupling and cohesion of the function.
* Learn Machine learning and integrate it into my data analysis journey.
