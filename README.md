# Overview

This is my first ever data analysis project. While it may look insignificant, this project is super important to me becuase it marks the very first step that I have taken into data analysis.

I am using a dataset that I got from Kaggle, it is a set of fake customer data. It describes several things about the customer including: Customer ID ,Age, Gender, Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount (USD), Location, Size, Color, Season, Review Rating, Subscription Status, Shipping Type, Discount Applied, Promo Code Used, Previous Purchases, Payment Method, Frequency of Purchases.

I have never used python to analyze data before and I am currently taking an advanced writing and reasoning class. Through this project and my writing class I became interested in asking questions and using data to answer them. I was also interested in learning about customer data and learning about different ways to improve sales through data analysis.

# Data Analysis Results

Does gender affect the payment method?
    - No. The gender specific data showed to be similar. I did find that Paypal and Cash were the most implemented payment methods.

Should the company focus on promoting a subscription?
    - Yes. Over half of the customers are not subscribed and frequently come back to repurchase items.

# Development Environment

I used the Python coding language and used the Pandas and MatplotLib libraries to analyze this dataSet. MatplotLib aided me in creating the data visuals as I extracted and displayed the data from a csv file and I was able to draw my conclusion based off of the visuals I displayed.

# Future Work

I really hope to learn more about data analysis and maybe even dive into machine learning. I am super interested about learning certain outcomes based of off data and finding answers to my questions. In the future I hope to use a real dataset to analize so I can get more realistic answers to my questions. Some other things I should work on in the future is:

* I need to find a better dataSet that has a bigger variety / is a better representation of customer data.
* Make the data filtering more efficient and improve the coupling and cohesion of the function.
* Learn Machine learning and integrate it into my data analysis journey.

I am super excited to learn more about data and how to analyze it in the future! Please reach out to me if you have any good tools to aid my begginer level knowledge in data analysis and machine learning!
